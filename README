#Text Simplifcation and Summarization System
This project has been developed for our bachelor's graduation project. 
It's a system that simplifies English Text on both the lexical and syntactic levels and also summarizes it.
For **Syntactic Simplification**, it utilizes RNN trained on Newsela Dataset , while **Lexical Simplification** is based on a Machine Learning Model trained on BenchLS. The **summarizer** is rule-based.
